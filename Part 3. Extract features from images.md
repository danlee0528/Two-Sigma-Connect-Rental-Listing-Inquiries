# Part 3. Extract features from images

The cvObjParser.py file takes two arguments, one for image output, and the other for the folder containing all the images for a listing. 

The script uses a pre-compiled computer vision model from a python library. The script will find  furniture, appliances, and plants, as we predict a listing with furniture will get more interest than a listing without. The script will also extract contrast values, and count the number of images. We predict that high contrast values mean listing will have post processing, and the more images a listing has will create more interest than a listing with no images, or a few images.

## Output images 

![object detection image 1](./obj_detection_imgs/object-detection_1.jpg)
![object detection image 2](./obj_detection_imgs/object-detection_2.png)
![object detection image 3](./obj_detection_imgs/object-detection_3.png)
![object detection image 4](./obj_detection_imgs/object-detection_4.jpg)
![object detection image 5](./obj_detection_imgs/object-detection_5.jpg)

## Feature extraction output

### Output for one listing
![output_image 1](./obj_detection_imgs/output_1.png)

### Output for all listings (took ~10 mins on sample images)
![output_image 2](./obj_detection_imgs/output_2.png)
